All features you find in NH are not enough to write your system. This is not because NH is poor, but only because some "things" are out of NH scope.

Using Google you can find many and  more resources for NH...
Do you like to have all in one pack ?
This is the target of **uNhAddIns**.

If you finds, or you writes, something for NH and you want share it with NH's users, you are welcome in **uNhAddIns**.
